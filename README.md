Bankruptcy prediction is a project aimed at developing a model to predict the likelihood of a company or individual filing for bankruptcy. The goal is to use historical data and various factors that can impact the financial health of a business or individual to develop an accurate prediction model.

The project typically involves collecting and analyzing financial data such as balance sheets, income statements, cash flow statements, and other financial indicators such as debt ratios, liquidity ratios, and profitability ratios. Other non-financial factors such as market trends, industry performance, and legal and regulatory changes may also be considered.

The prediction model can be based on various techniques, including statistical models, machine learning algorithms, and deep learning models. The model can be trained on historical data and then used to make predictions about the future financial health of a company or individual.

The project can be used by financial institutions, credit rating agencies, and government agencies to assess the risk of lending money to a company or individual. Accurate bankruptcy prediction can help businesses and investors to make informed decisions, mitigate risks, and optimize their operations. It can also help regulatory bodies to monitor the financial health of companies and individuals and take appropriate actions to prevent bankruptcy and protect the wider economy.
